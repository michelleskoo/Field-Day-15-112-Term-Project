Project Name: Field Day

Description:
This project is a golf statistics with the full user experience from directly entering golf statistics real time to
adding courses into the course database if the selected course is not available.
The user will be able to track golf shots while playing and get an overview of the golf statistics from the day or from a longer period of time. 

The project is essentially two parts, content creator and player experience.
The content creator program will allow a user to get static images of the golf course, 
mark the different holes on the course, and the components of each individual hole (greens and fairways).
This information will be saved in a separate file, in which the user program will refer to for golf course data.
The user program is where a player will be able to view the statistics from past rounds 
and enter data while playing on a golf course real time.

Overall, a user will be able to analyze golf statistics for areas in their game they improve on, 
save golf rounds and the resulting statistics, 
and retrieve information for an optimal aimpoint on a specific hole for course management strategies.
